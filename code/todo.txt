TODO list for the code:

Valtteri:
	- Implement some higher abstraction for the boundaries, of the form mesh.bdof(k)
	  that returns the edges of tau_h corresponding to k:th face of omega. This should
	  allow defining non-square domains and still access boundaries easily. Modifications
	  will be made to inittri.m and make_rect_mesh.m
	- Edit: mesh.bdof gives the indices of the boundary edges in the system matrix and
		mesh.bvals gives the values corresponding to mesh.bdof
